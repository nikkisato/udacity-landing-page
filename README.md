# Landing Page Project

##Feature

- In this project, I used JavaScript to navigate through the DOM
- dynamically build the navigation menu, and used javascript to implement which sections to go to
- include smooth scroll behavior on click from the navigation
- Responsive Web Design
- Scroll to Anchor (not using the href on the HTML side)
- Section Active State
