# Landing Page Project

- In this project, I used JavaScript to navigate through the DOM
- dynamically build the navigation menu, and used javascript to implement which sections to go to
- include smooth scroll behavior on click from the navigation
- Responsive Web Design
- Scroll to Anchor (not using the href on the HTML side)
- Section Active State

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
